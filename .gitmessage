# The following template is designed to help you create understandable commits.
# Voice: Write your commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed
# bug" or "Fixes bug." This convention matches up with commit messages
# generated by commands like git merge and git revert.
# ==============================================================================
# Title: short (72 chars or less) summary.

# Summary: More detailed explanatory text. Wrap it to 72 characters. The blank
line separating the summary from the body is critical.

# Why: More paragraphs to explain why the change was made.
# - Bullet points are okay
# - Use a hypen followed by a single space

# Link to any relevant tickts, issues, and so on.
